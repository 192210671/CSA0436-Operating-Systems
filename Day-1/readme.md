# Operating Systems: C Programming Exercises

## Introduction

This repository contains several C programs designed to demonstrate fundamental concepts in operating systems, including process creation, file manipulation, and various CPU scheduling algorithms. Each program illustrates a specific aspect of operating systems, from basic system calls to complex scheduling techniques.
